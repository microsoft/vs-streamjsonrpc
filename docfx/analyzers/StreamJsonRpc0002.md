# StreamJsonRpc0002: Declare partial interfaces

Interfaces with <xref:StreamJsonRpc.JsonRpcContractAttribute> applied should be declared as `partial`, and all its containing types should also be declared as `partial`, so that the source generator may apply attributes to the interface that enables runtime discovery of the source generated proxy class

## Resolution

Add `partial` to the interface any all containing types.
