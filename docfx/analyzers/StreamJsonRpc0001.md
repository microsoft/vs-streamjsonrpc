# StreamJsonRpc0001: Inaccessible interface

Interfaces with <xref:StreamJsonRpc.JsonRpcContractAttribute> applied must be declared with at least `internal` visibility so that the source generator can implement that interface with an implementing proxy class.

## Example violation

The following RPC interface is declared as a nested, `private` type.

## Resolution
